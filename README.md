# GettingAndCleaningDataCoursera
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The basic rundown of the script goes as follow:

Setting up directory

Extract data from respective test and training file

Replace the variable name for a more descriptive one

Replace numerical observations for "activity" variable for a more descriptive one

Merge both train and test data frame as one data frame and make sure it is still a tidy data by creating an additional column for the type of data (namely "train" and "test")

Select only the mean() and std() variable column

Create a data frame with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
